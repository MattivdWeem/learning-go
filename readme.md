# Matti is learning GO
### And since he is good at getting lost in files, GIT THEM ALL ;)



### what did i learn?

#### installing go
`brew install go`

#### Running your project
`go run projectName`

#### compiling your project
`go build`

#### now you can do `./` magic
`./projectName` 

### about go
go's default io library = fmt

go's way of saying you need this and that is import

All go files must be inside a package

go devs are lazy and use func instead of function

als no semicolon and bracket sugar



#### More stuff i did actualy learn about go


##### http calls? No problem

`import nt/http`

`http.Get("example.com")`

done!
