# Matti is learning GO
### And since he is good at getting lost in files, GIT THEM ALL ;)



### what did i learn?

#### installing go
`brew install go`

#### compiling your project
`go build`

#### Running your project
`go run projectName`

And ofcourse since go code gets compiled 
`./projectName` 

### about go
go's default io library = fmt
go's way of saying you need this and that is import
All go files must be inside a package

go devs are lazy and use func instead of function

als no semicolon and bracket sugar
